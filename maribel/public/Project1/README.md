# Project 1: Voy Al Mercadona Kieres Algo
A simple application wich allows you to enter the ingredients you have in your kitchen and search for recipes that, at least, contains those ingredients. If the recipe needs some ingredient that you hadn't entered, it will appear inside the "Missed ingredients" section. It will be possible to add to the cart those missed ingredients in case you want to buy them (but there is no real buy process).

Desired enhancements:
- Better UI and UX.
- Show quantity of the product to buy when it is added to the cart.
- Show (average?) price of the product to buy when it is added to the cart.
- Possibility of removing items from the cart.

- Apply good practices to code (modularity, patterns, decoupling, etc).
